                            <li>When an object is in motion either on a surface or in a viscous medium such as air or water, there is resistance to the motion because the object interacts with its surroundings. We call such resistance a force of friction.</li><br>

                            <li><i>Friction (f)</i></li>
                            <li>• It is a tangential force acting on an object that opposes the sliding of that object on an adjacent surface with which it is in contact.</li>
                            <li>• Primarily due to the roughness of the surfaces in contact.</li>
                            <li>• Parallel to the surface and opposite to the direction of motion or of impending motion</li>

                                <li><i>Two Types of Friction</i></li>
                                <ul class="uk-list">
                                    <li>1.	Static friction (fs) - Acts when motion is just impending. No actual motion yet.</li>
                                    <li>1.	Kinetic friction (fk) - Acts when the body is already in motion.</li>
                                    <li><i>The force of static friction is generally greater than the force of kinetic friction</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>• Friction is proportional to the normal force, N.</li>
                            <li>Whenever a body is in contact with a surface, whether the body is moving or not, there is always a reaction of the surface to the total perpendicular force exerted on it by the body. This is called the <i>Normal Force</i>. It is exerted by the surface on the body and is always perpendicular to the surfaces in contact</li>

                                <li>Where: μ is the coefficient of friction</li>
                                <li>The coefficient of friction depends on the surfaces in contact and are nearly independent of the area of contact.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>For static friction, the equals sign is valid only at impeding motion( the surfaces are on the verge of slipping) and use the inequality if the surfaces are not on the verge of slipping</li><br>
                            <li>Friction is a force, so it simply is included in the ∑F in Newton’s Laws</li>
                            <li>When solving problems involving Newton's laws and force, it is very important to draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on each object involved. Such a diagram is called a free-body diagram, or force diagram: choose one object, and draw an arrow to represent each force acting on it. Include every force acting on that object. If the problem involves more than one object, a separate free-body diagram is needed for each object. We consider for now, the likely forces that could be acting are gravity and contact forces (one object pushing or pulling another, normal force, friction).</li>
